But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing of a pleasure and praising pain was born. 
To take a trivial example none of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise except to obtain some advantage from it. 
Nobody has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences. 
One who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure. 
On the other hand we denounce with righteous indignation. 
These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish.
